NOTE 1:- This assignment requires the Plotly library to be installed on the user's environment. (The 'pip install plotly' command worked fine for me).

NOTE 2:- Small changes were made to the datasets in the notebook directory, so the CSV files included with the project zip are the ones that 
must be used.

NOTE 3: - In deployment testing I found it necessary to run the Notebook at least once in order for the Plotly graphs to render.
